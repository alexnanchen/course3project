# README
This is the README for the course project Getting and Cleaning data.

In the git you will find two files. The first one is an R script that you can run to download and tidy the original data and the second one is the code book for the tidy data.

Here are the instructions to execute the R script:

1. Set the WORKDIR variable at the top of the script file. This is going to be the location where the data is downloaded
2. Source the file from RStudio or R
3. The output is a CSV file named tidy_data.csv that contains the tidy data
